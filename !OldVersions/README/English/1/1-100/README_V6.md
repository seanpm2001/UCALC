Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/UltimateCalculator/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# UltimateCalculator
UCALC (Ultimate Calculator) is an advanced Python-based calculator that was my first major Python project.

***

## About

See above. UCALC is a very advanced calculator project that aims to be the most advanced calculator, that can replace current calculators, and serve as a calculator with all the features you would ever need. It is designed to be highly portable, stable, and lightweight. It currently can run on any operating system that supports Python 3. It also has its own planned separate embedded operating system project in the works, planned to be based on Tiny Core Linux or ArchBang Linux (a decision is still underway)

***
  
## History

This project has a long history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was started in early 2018 as a Python calculator project to test my Python knowledge during High School, and try to provide an alternative to the schools calculators. Despite my poor performance in my math classes (I have a problem showing what I know and regurgating certain information) the idea was popular among the people I shared the project with. The project was open source at the time, but I had very little knowledge of technology, as I was still beginning, and didn't fully understand the significance of open source yet. Nevertheless, the project never had any thought on becoming proprietary, and never was made proprietary (freeware and shareware also counts as proprietary, as it is not open source)

The base project was written in Python 3.6.2 under Windows 10, tested with a 4 gigabyte of RAM device with a Intel Celeron CPU.

The project received lots of development for several months, I noted that my schools calculators gave an overflow error when calculating 2^34 or higher, so I concluded that the TI-80 calculators my school mostly used were 33 bit devices, giving me my first marketing point for the project, being that due to it being based on Python, it doesn't stop at 10 digits for calculation, and the Python IDE I used on a low end Windows 10 laptop was able to easily calculate answers that gave you small numbers for several pages without any error (meaning it can easily calculate a number equivalent to several thousand Googols)

The project received additional features, such as screensavers, small video games, but the program as a whole remained a command line only project. (as of August 15th 2021, there is still no GUI, unless you count the usage of ASCII art)

The project was then abandoned for over a year.

### Alpha history

On May 29th 2020, the project was moved to GitHub, and over the course of May 29th to May 30th 2020, the project was fully uploaded to GitHub. It took longer than it would nowadays, as at the time, I didn't know how to upload directories yet (I hadn't discovered that you could yet) and I also had to examine the source code for sensitive content, and found none. The project was then abandoned for 15 months.

On May 26th 2021, this project received its own GitHub organization to better host the projects development.

On Saturday, 2021 August 14th, the project was updated, as I had recently gained interest in the project again with 2 new factors sparking my interest:

* Adding support for Boolean Algebra

* Getting the program to the point of functionality where it can replace my current Linux calculator (GNOME Calculator) and so I can have my own in-house software project (that is not a webpage or web-app) that I contributed a significant role in, to use by me, on a daily basis.

The project received some updates this day, and had a license change. It was also modernized with my modern GitHub standards, along with some newer experimental standards. It also received its own website and Snapcraft Linux package.

On August 15th 2021, the project was updated. Its `README.md` file was updated and modernized, and its website was updated to include the new modernized `README.md` file.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

***

## Project info

All versions: over ~~828 (inaccurate)~~ 260 megabytes in size (in the base system (base 10 or base 2, I can't figure it out at the moment. I know it is the one that Windows and Android **Don't** use (which is 1000 bytes per Kilobyte and not 1024 bytes per Kibibyte)

***

## Installation

---
Installing UCALC (Ultimate Calculator)
---

UCALC currently doesn't require installation (as of August 14th 2021) although it requires 1 program/package to be installed:

* Python 3.5 or higher

Once you do this, each individual script should be ran through the Python console, and will act as a separate mode of the calculator.

## Dependencies

This project currently has 1 package dependency:

1. Python 3.6.2

I know that this version is getting old, and may need to be updated in the future, but due to its source code style, it should still remain functional with all Python versions 3.0 and up (version 3.5 or higher is recommended) (as of 2021 August 15th) as long as the next version of Python isn't as big of a change as Python 2.7 to Python 3.0, as that would break the syntax.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Frequently asked questions

No questions have been asked yet, so I have added some that may get asked

***

#### How does this make the TI-80 primitive technology?

The TI-80 (I might have the wrong model number) is only a 33 bit calculator. It performs very basic actions, and has a very small overflow limit.

UCALC is a 64 bit calculator client that is written in Python. For non-decimal equations, the only limit of the calculation is how much processing power you have. UCALC can easily perform equations such as 1000^1000 with a computer with just 4 Gigabytes of RAM and a 2.3 Ghz processor and give the full answer, while the TI can't give you a full answer above 2^33.

## Cool UNIX tricks

I created these files (COPYING, CREDITS, INSTALL) on August 14th 2021, as I have noted that on Linux/GNOME, these files have a special icon when detected (first discovered through the MediaWiki 7 source code package) and I wanted a project to have them.

No other cool UNIX tricks right now, sorry. Although fun fact, `lslocks` is a command on Ubuntu/GNOME that shows you all dependencies that are locked. Also, `fuser` is a command that displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems. [Source: ComputerHope](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/fuser.htm)

***

## Current issues

> * 1. Some files were not uploaded yet, as they contained sensitive links. Less than 10 files aren't available on GitHub

> * 2. Program is not yet completely functional in many areas

> * 3. The camera calculation tool (CDoc) is not functioanl yet

***

## Fixed issues

~~> * 1. I have 2 huge directories that I couldn't add in tonight. The English directories inside the UCALC Shell/CLI. It was originally a fairly easy process. I would upload them all at once, I could do it in one go. Newer versions had more versions, so I had to do it in multiple batches (due to a 100 file at once upload limit on GitHub) the problem now is that for 2 versions of the English directory, there are several subdirectories, with more subdirectories inside the directories subdirectories. It is going to be a nightmare to get them all uploaded, due to how long it is going to take.~~

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
