<H1>32 bit support</H1>
<p>32 bit support is available for Ultimate Calculator. Originally, I wasn't aware about Python's arbitrary precision and the fact that it isn't based off integers for most parts of development. So 32 bit support is fully available, however, it is 2019. You shouldn't still be using 32 bit computers (unless you are in a virtual machine) you should be using 64 bit computers</p>
