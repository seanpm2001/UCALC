<H1>Beta versions - All-in-one</H1>
<p>The earliest versions of Ultimate Calculator were made in a single Python file. Most versions don't work, as features were being piled on and fixed in later builds. This lasted for quite some time, before it started to lag too much (on a 4 GB RAM computer) and it was switched over to a series of hundreds of files.</p>
