# The UCALC Operating System

## Kernel

The UCALC Operating System will make use of the Linux Kernel and a super lightweight Linux distribution. I am still looking for one, my prequisites are:

* Requires less than 128 megabytes of RAM (to run the operating system, desktop environment, and a terminal, with free RAM available)

* Has 64 bit processor support (cannot be a 32 bit/16 bit/8 bit only Linux distribution)

* Supports the latest Python packages (Python 3.0 or greater)

* Is from a trusted distributor (does not contain spyware or backdoors)
