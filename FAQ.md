How does this make the TI-80 primitive technology?
-----------

The TI-80 (I might have the wrong model number) is only a 33 bit calculator. It performs very basic actions, and has a very small overflow limit.

UCALC is a 64 bit calculator client that is written in Python. For non-decimal equations, the only limit of the calculation is how much processing power you have. UCALC can easily perform equations such as 1000^1000 with a computer with just 4 Gigabytes of RAM and a 2.3 Ghz processor and give the full answer, while the TI can't give you a full answer above 2^33.
