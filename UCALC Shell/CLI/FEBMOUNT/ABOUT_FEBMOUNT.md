# About the FebMount directory

The FebMount directory is an experimental directory from **FEB**ruary 2019. It was **MOUNT**ed into the CLI directory as part of a test branch. It is the experimental branch for an important new innovative feature to calculating (which has been done before) where you use a camera to solve equations for you. It is a lazy thing, I would rather enter the equations myself most of the time, but there might be an instance where to be productive, it is better to take a picture and get an answer in a few seconds rather than writing out the equation and solving it in a minute.

The FebMount directory is still under construction, that is because I don't have the capability to do it myself yet. I also abandoned the project in February 2019 in favor of a much bigger project.
