<H1>Compatibility</H1>
<H1>On 32 bit architecture</H1>
<p>Ultimate calculator is not fully supported on 32 bit architecture. It is recommended to use 64 bit or higher</p>
<H1>For Windows XP</H1>
<p>Ultimate calculator compatibility goes back all the way to Windows XP. However, you can't use normal Windows XP. You have to use Windows XP x64 edition. We recommend using a virtual machine as Windows XP support is long gone, and it is best used in a virtual machine</p>
<H1>For iOS</H1>
<p>Due to the lack of support for 32 bit architectures, the oldest version of iOS that UCALC can run on is iOS 11. It is a 64 bit only device, and it works perfectly with our program.</p>
<H1>For Ubuntu</H1>
<p>32 bit versions of Ubuntu are not supported. All versions of Ubuntu have a 64 bit variant. It should run fine on ARM64, AMD64, Intel x64, and other 64 bit architectures</p>
