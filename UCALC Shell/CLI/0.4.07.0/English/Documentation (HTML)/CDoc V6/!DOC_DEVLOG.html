<p>After a long hiatus, I have gotten back to development on the calculator. There is now a competitor and it has brought me back to the project:</p>
<p>Someone has made a calculator that can take a picture of a page of equations and solve them all at once. I now plan to build this into my program but modify and improve it</p>
<p>UCALC will now require access to the camera and a better use of internal storage when this mode is needed. Development has come back, it looks like a mess, but I think I can deal with it without restarting, as I have come too far to start over</p>
