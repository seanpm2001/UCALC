Installing UCALC (Ultimate Calculator)
----

UCALC currently doesn't require installation (as of August 14th 2021) although it requires 1 program/package to be installed:

* Python 3.5 or higher

Once you do this, each individual script should be ran through the Python console, and will act as a separate mode of the calculator.
